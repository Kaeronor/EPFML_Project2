## TODO:
1. *Rigoroulsy* find a good model:
   1. Compare to some baseline methods
   2. What we have tried, different "steps", and if they did work, or not
      * compare the evolution of evaluation metric, i.e. F1-score

2. Report (4 pages PDF)

   **OverLeaf link:** https://www.overleaf.com/12880986jnctkgpxbpwq#/49224066/
   
   Explain our steps to find our final model, etc.

3. Code:
   1. `run.py`: to reproduce our final submission *.csv* file
   2. with its README (explain how to run the code, install librairies, etc.)
